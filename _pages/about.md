ElectroAudio is my musical artificial alter ego, which is an audio-to-audio model's architecture and training process. Initially, based on Stable Audio Open and stable-audio-tools, it has evolved into a more sophisticated architecture for audio-to-audio music generation, with a focus on electronic music. Additional information about this version will be available soon !
